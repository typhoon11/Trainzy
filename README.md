# Trainzy

This was a Class 12th Computer Science Project for CBSE Board. This software is a demostration of the modern day train ticket reservation system. It has it's backend database using MySQL and the frotend is a simple Python based CLI. 

## Changes that can be done
- [ ] Change the UI/UX to Python Tkinter so make it easy to use for other people
- [ ] Use real life train database, that can be fetched from Indian Railway's official API.
- [ ] Use alogrithm to assign seats to passengers according to their age, gender and train's carrying capacity.


## Tips before using
This project was just made for school exam point of view and can contain tons of bugs, and the train database part is hard coded that means it just tons of object of train for certain time period. So if you are looking to scale this project you can open a Pull Request.


## Final
I hope this will help you for your exams too and if you like it, do put a star. 
Thank You üòÅ
